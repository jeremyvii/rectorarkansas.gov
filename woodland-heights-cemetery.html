        Located on the northwest edge of the city, Woodland Heights
        Cemetery stretches along a beautiful rolling countryside that makes
        up the beginnings of the Crowley's Ridge foothills as they enter
        the city limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone in the community agrees that Woodland Heights is one of
        the most beautiful and best-maintained cemeteries in the region.
        The cemetery is owned by the city and operated by commission
        members. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The cemetery is operated on a sound financial basis, with all
        proceeds from the annual 
        <a class="usa-link" href="/labor-day-picnic">Labor Day Picnic</a> going 
        toward its maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Approximately 6451 are buried in the cemetery, including some 814
        veterans. The Rector Veterans of Foreign Wars post conducts a
        Memorial Day service each year at Woodland Heights.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>It is my sincere wish that the information contained on this cemetery web page will be of use to current and future generations when they are seeking information about their families and their burial places. I have tried to be as accurate as possible but I know that errors and omissions have been made. If you find errors or know of any omissions please send that information to Woodland Heights Cemetery, P.O. Box 204, Rector, AR and we can correct that in future updates.</p>
      <p>I would like to thank the Clay County EHC for reading the cemetery markers in 1968-9 and Camilla Cox for reading again in 1985-6. They gave me the courage that the job could be done. Thanks to Larry Norred who talked me through getting the information set up on computer to make organizing data and searching files easier. Thanks to Barbara McKeel and the Rector Public Library for the records they have kept and organized. This helped to add more information than was found on the grave stones.</p>
      <p>I give my permission to copy any family information that you need<br>&mdash; Betty Essman.</p>
