      Rector begins a metamorphosis each year on the Friday before the Labor Day
      holiday. Our sleepy little town wakes up and people start coming into town.
      Friday evening we have the rodeo. Hosted by the Rector Saddle Club, rodeo
      enthusiasts gather from surrounding towns to watch and participate in various
      events.

      The Ultimate Oldies Show brings all those songs we used to dance to, back to
      life in the Rector Community Center on Friday evening. Proceeds from this
      event go to the support of the Community Center. Class reunions, family
      reunions and work reunions also begin on Friday, calling back Rector residents
      from around the country. The population swells to many times the normal. Just
      about everyone who has every lived in Rector comes home to see family and
      friends and share memories from “the old days.”

      Saturday morning a 5-K run raises funds for the Rector High School Helping
      Hands Foundation which is a non-profit organization to help local children in
      need. Sunday the local churches open their doors to welcome out-of-towners to
      join them in worship. And of course the reunions continue making the entire
      long weekend a time of gathering and remembering. Rector is certainly the
      place to be on Labor Day. Begun in 1941, the celebration has grown from a one
      day event into a full four days of fun, family and friends.

      The parade on Monday morning leads everyone to the picnic grounds. There are
      beauty pageants for all ages, a talent show, political speeches, music, games,
      carnival rides, and of course food to beckon former residents and people who
      have heard of our celebration from all over the United States and elsewhere in
      the world. Even CNN has been known to show up for the political sparring.
