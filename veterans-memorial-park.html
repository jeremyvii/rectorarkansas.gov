            Located on the east side of South Main Street just north of US 
            Highway 49, the Veterans Memorial Park of Rector honors those who 
            served in the Armed Forces. Developed through a partnership between 
            the City of Rector and the Veterans' Memorial Park Association, it 
            stands as a tribute to those who served and continue to serve.

            The centerpiece is a bronze WWII soldier, sculpted by Gary Aslum, 
            standing atop a native Arkansas boulder. This statue symbolizes all 
            five branches of service: Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast 
            Guard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surrounding the statue are service flags, including POW/MIA, the 
            Arkansas state flag, and the City of Rector flag—presided over by 
            the always-illuminated United States flag.

            Heritage Walkway begins at the Visitor Center and includes 
            commemorative granite pavers engraved with the names of local 
            heroes. Special stones honor those killed in action.

        The Visitor Center, formerly the jail and water office, is now the
        park headquarters and home to the Rector Area Chamber of Commerce.
        It also features the Founders Wall, which honors major donors who
        helped create the park.
      </p>

        Land for the park was donated by Pauline Crockett, Mr. and Mrs.
        Sherland Hamilton, George Jernigan, and Robert Jernigan.

        Support continues through the Veterans Memorial Park Association
        and Downtown Central/Main Street Arkansas.
